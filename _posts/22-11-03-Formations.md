## Introduction

One of the hottest issues in modern football debate is how efficient one formation is compared to another. In the absence of a perfect answer, history exists in decline and flow between one formation and the next as the manager overcomes current fads and invents new tactics.

Fierce competition for new knowledge and innovation is one of the main drivers for the continued development of sports. Undoubtedly, a coach who can implement a formation strategy unfamiliar to the opponent will have a huge competitive advantage.

We analyzed the most popular formations in today's football and summarized the most important strengths and weaknesses.

 

## (1) 4-4-2
![IMdb Page](\img\posts\strategy\4-4-2.png)
The oldest formation widely used in modern football, the 4-4-2, was used by many teams around the world, but the prevailing opinion is that the golden age of the 4-4-2 has declined. For today's top-tier clubs in the world, the use of the 4-4-2 tactic is often viewed as a failure and is perceived as an unsure of their ability to move forward.

The 4-4-2 is still a powerful strategy because it is easy to implement and understand by players on a well-trained team, but it lacks the sophistication provided by more modern and forward-looking tactics.

 

### Strength

Due to the two striker forward placement, the midfielder and defender do not need to delay their offensive work. Unlike tactics that use one-saws, the 4-4-2 allows for an immediate attack without wasting time waiting for midfield support. Having two wingers on both sides and a wide full-back creates room for two strikers, as it allows the opponent to widen the defensive line to counter flank threats. Because of these clear advantages and the ease of strategizing, many teams choose the 4-4-2 when defending deep into their own half.

 

### Weakness

The issues with the 4-4-2 in general are predictability and rigidity, and there is also pressure from the central midfielder to constantly alternate between attack and defense. However, over a long period of time, various methods have been developed to overcome the weakness of the formation. This is a way to lighten the defensive burden on both wingers with a 4-4-2.

Having only two midfielders in the center can make it difficult to keep the ball on the ball against a team that plays with three central midfielders, but sometimes it comes down to the midfield area when one of the two strikers is not trying to gain possession.

To compensate for this, many 4-4-2 players must play a defensive central midfielder so that the defensive line is not pressed against the opponent's attack-focused player. However, in this case, there may be a side effect that the entire formation is distributed in the center.


### Dominant formation?

It's hard to pinpoint a formation where 4-4-2 is particularly dominant, but there are times when you need to use this system for aggressive team play. The players are evenly distributed throughout the pitch, opening up the possibility of an immediate attack as soon as you regain possession of the ball.

## (2) 4-3-3
![IMdb Page](\img\posts\strategy\4-3-3.png)
After great success as manager Jose Mourinho at Chelsea, the system is still popular among the best clubs in the world today. This is beneficial for teams of players with very skilled passing skills and is well implemented in systems that prioritize intelligent ball movement as a means to create scoring opportunities.

 

### Strength

By placing two very skilled forwards wide on the left and right, he has the strength to get a chance to negate the threat posed by the opponent's full-back. When the wide forward is deployed deep in the opponent's camp, the opponent's defense becomes dangerous the moment the opponent's full-back joins the attack, so it has the effect of limiting the opponent's attack options using the full-back.

Midfield is played by three players, one of whom has a defensive streak and the other two take on an all-round 'box-to-box' role, so you can seize ownership in midfield against a team that only plays two in center. can Holding the ball in midfield for a long enough time doesn't give opponents a lot of counter-attacking opportunities, which has the effect of giving fellow full-backs more opportunities to attack.

This system also makes it easier for a team to react when under strong pressure from an opponent by transforming into a more defensive 4-1-4-1.

 

## Weakness

To be as successful as possible with the 4-3-3, you need to have players with quick judgment in terms of positioning and distribution.

The central striker has a huge responsibility to keep the ball in possession and allow his team-mates to attack in a wide space. While this appears to be a goal achievable with teammates and players, there are few strikers in the world who can perform this role well when confronted with elite-level defenders.

Likewise, teams that have had success with this formation tend to deploy world-class defensive midfielders. Claude Makelele, Javier Mascherano, Sergio Busquets... All of these players also have the ability to protect the defense as their central midfield partners move forward to help their offensive moves through the center of the pitch.

When teammates decide that strikers and defensive midfielders cannot create offensive opportunities or block opponents' chances, the entire system tends to collapse due to a lack of trust.

 

## Dominant formation?

4-4-2: A player in the center of the midfielder can overwhelm the two midfielders in the 4-4-2 center with a numerical advantage, and an attacker who is wide left and right is behind when the opponent's 4-4-2 full-back moves up. space can be used.

 

## (3) 4-2-3-1
![IMdb Page](\img\posts\strategy\4-2-3-1.png)
Sometimes it can seem like every club on the planet chooses the 4-2-3-1 formation. This makes it look like today's Premier League teams have loved the formation they've seen in Spain and Germany over the years, and it's undoubtedly the system of choice for many top clubs today.

### Strength

The attack development pass through the triangular arrangement of the 4-2-3-1 tactic is more effective in destroying the opponent than the straight attack pass. The position of the two central midfielders is tailored to create these passing options, reducing the problem of being straight or flanked by flat systems like the 4-4-2.

It also prevents midfield overruns when using the 4-2-3-1 as it provides great flexibility for players with good ability to position themselves into a wide area deep into the opponent or into a central area. Moreover, in the event of a sudden counterattack opportunity, the number of potential attacking players can be increased, which means that they can penetrate deeper while continuing to pose an aggressive threat.

Also, the striker in this formation has a lot of chances to score as there are so many players available and always ready to send the ball forward.

 

### Weakness

Physical strain can be a problem for a team using a 4-2-3-1. It is common for strikers to start attacking from deep within the opponent to create confusion and misdirection of the opposing defender. And sometimes the attack starts with a key defender.

Therefore, strikers must play at a high tempo to get their opponents moving from one end of the pitch to the other without allowing enough time for the opposing midfielders and fullbacks to recover from their ideal positions. The physical tension of the players due to such play may result in not being in the best condition due to the accumulation of fatigue in the second half of the season.

Also, when the opponent passes the ball defensively, it is a huge burden on the attackers who have to quickly retreat to defense. This burden sometimes creates a conflict of opinion between certain players and coaches.

 

### Dominant formation?

4-4-2: You can easily neutralize the midfield pressure by using a triangular pass. The flat midfield structure of 4-4-2 means that it is difficult to break through the multi-layer structure of 4-2-3-1.

 

## (4) 4-5-1 (+ 4-1-4-1)
![IMdb Page](\img\posts\strategy\4-5-1.png)
The 4-5-1 is often the formation of choice for teams looking to avoid defeat, with a focus on filling the midfield to maintain possession and make it difficult for opponents to break through the center.

However, instead of gaining defensive cohesion and tempo management, it is less intimidating when attacking. In this system, it is difficult to launch a surprise and unusual attack. This is especially true when deploying a flank midfielder for defensive purposes rather than forward threats.

4-1-4-1 can be viewed as a variant of 4-5-1. In general, however, this system is part of the very popular three-man central midfielder style today.

 

### Strength

Teams that adopt a 4-5-1 tend to enjoy dominant possession because there are so many players in the center of the pitch. In some cases, you can see the striker lowered to a back position as the team is trying to get the ball back. Basically you play 4-6-0, making it incredibly difficult for your opponent to break through the line.

Likewise, an aggressive application is possible. It's relatively simple to push two flank midfielders up the pitch and form a close to 4-3-3 with no substitutions. In this case, you will often see a team placing a 4-3-3 at the start of a match, and if the team leads by scoring the first goal, it will immediately return to a 4-5-1.

It is common to see the 4-5-1 in-game in tournaments as it is very easy to change the way a flank player plays while maintaining a central defensive structure.

 

### Weakness

Because of their focus on controlling the midfield, the lone striker in the 4-5-1 tends to be isolated. The first goal is because the midfielder is not always ready to support the striker, unlike when playing a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3, and consequently it becomes very difficult to manage the game if the opponent scores first in this formation. It is often seen that the formation is completely reconstructed after allowing

Also, depending on the style of the 4-5-1 implemented, it may be difficult to counterattack. Strikers are usually isolated, so you have to wait for the midfielder to have time to advance and influence the pass sequence. If such an attack delay occurs, the opposing defense will form a defensive formation, reducing the threat of counterattack.

 

### Dominant formation?

4-3-3: The 4-5-1's three-man central midfielder fits well with the version seen in the 4-3-3, and the flank midfielder is easy to defend against the opponent's attacking wide options.

 

## (5) 3-5-2
![IMdb Page](\img\posts\strategy\3-5-2.png)
The 3-5-2, the most popular in Italy, dominated the mini-renaissance era. For this system to work well, you need a very capable and tactical wingback.

 

### Strength

It is wise to consider a 3-5-2 when playing against a strong counter-attacking team. The three defenders should be able to handle any combination of No.10 with the opposing striker between them, and the wingback should be in a good position to defend before the opposing flank player advances too far.

The defensive structure is assisted by a central midfielder in a relatively deep position to help cover the wingback if needed.

However, the 3-5-2 is just as effective as a counter-attack launcher or counter-attack weapon. The three midfielders and two wingbacks offer potential attacking versatility that burdens opposing defenders, while the use of two strikers means they can create opportunities and score goals with minimal assistance on counterattacks.

 

### Weakness

The complexity of the formation, especially when covering teammates and launching offenses, requires a certain mix of players as well as certain types of players. The three-backs must include at least one player who is good at passing, and the other two players must be very good at one-to-one marking and well-trained in position.

It is possible to play the local defense system in 3-5-2, but to do so requires a good sense of positioning and a player with the speed to catch up with opponents playing in and out to create space between the defenders. For this reason, it is not uncommon to see players generally considered midfielders backing up three defenses.

 

### Dominant formation?

4-5-1: 3-5-2 means that 4-5-1 has the same number of midfielders and because the opponent has one striker and attacks, one of the defenders can attack into the opposing half. . And when the ball is in possession, the defender can provide support as an additional midfielder.
