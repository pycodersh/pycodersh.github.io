## Real-Madrid Coaching Career

3 Champions Leagues

2 Club World Cups

2 European Super Cups

2 Spanish Leagues

2 Spanish Super Cups
A unique record set by Zinedine Zidane as Real Madrid manager
Zinedine Zidane wins three consecutive Champions League titles
Zidane won a trophy every 19 games for Real Madrid as manager
Fastest manager in top 5 league history to win 8 titles with a single club
Zidane is the only manager with Real Madrid to defend the Champions League and Club World Cup at the same time
Conceded only 23 goals during the 2019-20 season compared to clubs in Europe's top 5 leagues

## Opinion 
Zidane created a good environment for the squad based on trust, and has shown an impressive record of winning 11 trophies in just six years as a manager at Real Madrid. The inexperienced galactico manager has now established himself as one of the best managers in Real Madrid's history, coveted by clubs and countries around the world.
