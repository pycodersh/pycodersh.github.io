Since the tournament started in 1955, 22 teams have raised the Big Ear so far. The competitions of big clubs with European elites and large fandoms lead to increased profits, so their popularity and marketability are unmatched in addition to their skills. In other words, it is a competition that determines the best and strongest among European clubs, and as the birthplace of modern football, the level is also the best among all football competitions. Moreover, since the European Cup was renamed the UEFA Champions League in 1992, the league's runners-up teams also got tickets to participate. It is enough to be taken as the greatest pride.

For example, Celtic FC fans made a spectacular appearance in the final home match of the 2016/17 season with a card section called 'Lisbon Lions' that covered the entire stadium, a phrase that was used in the 1967 European Cup final in Lisbon. It is the nickname of Celtic players who defeated FC Internazionale Milan to win the championship. Even after 50 years have passed, this one win is a very important event that will never be forgotten by the fans as a great honor.

Moreover, the difficulty of winning is also very high, unlike other competitions. Since it is a tournament with a deep history and tradition, it is quite difficult to win. Also, tournaments and group matches are played during the league, which means that the schedule is tighter than most teams in the league. To make matters worse, unless you win a championship, you need to finish at the top of the league in order to participate in the Champions League next season. In addition to that, even if it is limited to only competitions, you have to run desperately because you will face strong teams in almost every match from the tight group stage and tournament to the final. During the European Cup, there were a few teams that made it to the finals even if they weren't part of the big leagues, but the gap widened as a bubble started to form in the transfer market after the turning point in the mid- to-late 2000s. As a result, it is now rare to see teams outside of the big leagues play in the Champions League. Moreover, it is even more difficult for a club that has never got of Big Ear. The 21st club came out in 1997, but the 22nd was born 15 years after that. And even after 10 years, the 23rd club hasn't come out yet.
